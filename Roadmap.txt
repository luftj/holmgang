*******************************

Concept
-where to store ai behaviour in maps? [1]
-equipped items as separate sprites with scenegraph? or exhaustive tilesets?
-world simulation outside viewport

Architecture/Technical Debt
-merge itemcomponent and equipmentcomponent?

Gamestate
-start new game with:
[X]-resetting state
--loading from map
[X]-resume game with loading from savestate
[X]-save game

Map handling
-load spawn points from object layer. -> point objects in object layer -> entityfactory interface. consider [1]

Gameplay
-movement
--velocity system -> needed for determining attack directions
-character actions/states
[/]--attacks
---attack speed
---attack directions? via current movement -> moving left: attack from left etc
---ranged attack -> key for swapping melee/ranged then normal or holding key for aiming ranged, keyup->shoot/throw
--block
---block directions? (except shield)
---backstab?
--dash/sprint
--roll (sideways dash) -> how to control?
--duck?
-equipment/items
[/]--picking up items
---auto equip
[X]--item stacks
[X]--equipping/unequipping items
[/]--dropping items
[X]---item stacks on ground?
---inventory and iso texture for every item -> dynamic getter in contentsupplier
--item classes etc
[/]--drawing equipped items
[/]--stats
--state, condition
--leveling
--highlight hovered-over items -> pickerSystem -> manipulate spriteComponent if has<PickableComponent>
---border texture effect?

AI
-pathfinding
--navmesh?
-more precise collision for ai (at least onscreen)
-factions/friend-or-foe detection
--pull aggro when attacked
-collision with other characters

UI
-HUD
--runes
-other
--inventory screen etc
--dialog screens?

Particle system and environmental effects
-weapon swoosh
-blood
-fire
-light and shadow -> apply texeffect when drawing map? or draw extra layer (worse performance)?

Environment interaction
-doors/map changes -> place in collision layer of map
-talking to npc
[X]simple speech: print text after interact
--complex dialogue: trade etc
-using usable things?
-movement speedon different soil types -> place in collision layer of map

menues
-options
--screen resolution
--fullscreen
-layouting
-loadgamescreen with savegame selection
-savegamescreen with filepath/savename specification?
