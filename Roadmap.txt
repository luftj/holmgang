*******************************

Concept
-how to store ai behaviour in maps? [1]
-equipped items as separate sprites with scenegraph? or exhaustive tilesets? [2]
-world simulation outside viewport

Architecture/Technical Debt
[X]-merge itemcomponent and equipmentcomponent?
-savefilehandler: maybe implement ISerialisable in Component, instead of relying on defalt ctor?
-field visibility in components
--some come into conflict with deserialisation -> deserialise method?

Gamestate
[X]-resetting state
[X]-resume game with loading from savestate
[X]-save game
[X]-store map in savegame
[ ]-loading entities from map
[ ]--store entity names/types in map, consider [1]
[ ]--entityfactory createfromstring method takes pos and type/name
[ ]--call above when initialising state from map (during mapchange)

Map handling
-decouple tiledmap handling to abstract map object (problems with collision detection?)
-load spawn points from object layer -> point objects in object layer -> entityfactory interface. consider [1]

Gameplay
[ ]-movement
[ ]--velocity system -> needed for determining attack directions
[X]--slide along obstacles
[/]-character actions/states
[/]--attacks
[ ]---attack speed
[ ]---attack directions? via current movement -> moving left: attack from left etc
[X]---ranged attack -> for aiming ranged, keyup->shoot/throw (other method: key for swapping melee/ranged then normal or holding key)
[X]----draw aiming help line
[X]----range and deceleration -> remove damagingcomponent after drop
[ ]----maybe use range instead of acceleration?
[ ]---throwing melee weapon and shield?
[ ]---push back enemies (especially when they block) -> weight field? consider static world objects as well
[/]-block
[ ]---block directions? (except shield)
[ ]---backstab?
[X]---damage shield
[ ]---reduce movement speed
[ ]--dash/sprint
[ ]--roll (sideways dash) -> how to control?
[/]-equipment/items
[ ]--inventory and iso texture for every item -> dynamic getter in contentsupplier
[X]--picking up items
[X]---auto equip
[X]--item stacks
[X]--equipping/unequipping items
[X]--dropping items
[X]---item stacks on ground
[X]--item classes/types
[/]--drawing equipped items
[ ]---consider [2]
[/]--stats
[X]--state, condition
[ ]--leveling
[ ]--highlight hovered-over items -> pickerSystem -> manipulate spriteComponent if has<PickableComponent> outlineeffect in spritebatch?
[ ]---border texture effect?

AI
[ ]-behaviour statemachine?
[ ]-pathfinding
[ ]--navmesh?
[X]-more precise collision for ai (at least onscreen)
[ ]-factions/friend-or-foe detection
[X]--pull aggro when attacked
[ ]--change faction relation when aggro is pulled
[ ]-collision with other characters
[ ]--collidercomponent for npc and static objects (enables different (future) map storage as well)

UI
[/]-HUD
[ ]--runes
[X]-inventory screen etc
[ ]-dialog screens? trade?

Particle system and environmental effects
[ ]-weapon swoosh
[ ]-fire
[ ]-light and shadow -> apply texeffect when drawing map? or draw extra layer (worse performance?)?
[X]-update particles in physicssystem or particlesystem
[X]-particle emitter component
[X]--cooldown
[/]--total num particles or expiration time (or rather recreate until time expires in system?)
[X]--randomness
[X]---in speed and lifespan
[X]---in direction
[X]-particle entity
[X]--sprite, expiration, particle component with velocity
[X]-blood
[X]--splatter (velocity = negative impact orientation) from attacks
[X]---higher with damage -> make sure, instagib still produces enough particles
[X]--slow bleeding (no velocity) dependant on hp -> healthsystem

Environment interaction
[ ]-doors/map changes -> place triggers in object layer of map
[ ]-talking to npc
[X]--simple speech: print text after interact
[ ]--complex dialogue: trade etc
[ ]---trade screen
[ ]----2x character component
[ ]----2 inventory displays
[ ]----swap when player items value >= npc items value
[ ]-----value system
[ ]----part stacks
[ ]-using usable things?
[ ]-movement speed on different soil types -> place in collision layer of map?

menues
-options
--screen resolution
--fullscreen
-layouting
--centering text
-loadgamescreen with savegame selection
-savegamescreen with filepath/savename specification?
-no exiting without saving?
